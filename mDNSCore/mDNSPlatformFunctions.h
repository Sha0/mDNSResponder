// mDNSPlatformInit() typically opens a communication endpoint, and starts listening for mDNS packets.

// When a packet is received, the PlatformSupport code calls mDNSCoreReceive()
// mDNSPlatformScheduleTask() indicates that a timer should be set,
// and mDNSCoreTask() should be called when the timer expires
// mDNSPlatformClose() tidies up on exit
